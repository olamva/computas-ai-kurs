Skills are stored in directories with a SKILL.md file that defines the skill's behavior. VS Code supports two types of skills:

-  Project skills, stored in your repository: .github/skills/ (recommended) or .claude/skills/ (legacy, for backward compatibility)
- Personal skills, stored in your user profile: ~/.copilot/skills/ (recommended) or ~/.claude/skills/ (legacy, for backward compatibility)
