# Plan
- [x] Add in-world text bubble meshes for animals and track them after model load
- [x] Update game loop to show/hide bubbles based on player proximity and randomize words
- [ ] Verify text bubbles render above animals without affecting existing interactions

# Review
- [ ] Tests run and results recorded
- [ ] Manual verification notes
